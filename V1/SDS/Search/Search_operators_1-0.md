# Search operators

Specify search operators in the ``query`` string to return more specific search results.

Operators | Description
----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
``AND`` | AND operator. For example, ``cat AND dog`` searches for streams containing both "cat" and "dog".  AND must be in all caps.
``OR``  | OR operator. For example, ``cat OR dog`` searches for streams containing either "cat" or "dog" or both.  OR must be in all caps.
``NOT`` | NOT operator. For example, ``cat NOT dog`` searches for streams that have the "cat" term or do not have "dog".  NOT must be in all caps.
``*``   | Wildcard operator. For example, ``cat*`` searches for streams that have a term that starts with "cat", ignoring case.
``:``   | Field-scoped query.  For example, ``id:stream*`` will search for streams where the ``id`` field starts with "stream", but will not search on other fields like ``name`` or ``description``.  <br> **Note:** Field names are camel case and are case sensitive.
``( )`` | Precedence operator. For example, ``motel AND (wifi OR luxury)`` searches for streams containing motel and either wifi or luxury (or both).

**Note:** You can use the wildcard ``*`` only once for each search term, except for the case of a Contains type query clause. In that case, two wildcards are allowed: one as prefix and one as suffix; for example, ``*Tank*`` is valid, but ``*Ta*nk``, ``Ta*nk*``, and ``*Ta*nk*`` are not supported. The wildcard ``*`` only works when specifying a single search term. For example, you can search for ``Tank*``, ``*Tank``, ``Ta*nk`` but not ``Tank Meter*``.

## : Operator

Set the fields to search using the following syntax:

```text
fieldname:fieldvalue
```

**Request**
The following example shows the ``':'`` operator.

```text
GET api/v1/Tenants/default/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=name:pump name:pressure
```

## \* Operator

Use the ``'*'`` character as a wildcard to specify an incomplete string.
**Query string**     | **Matches field value** | **Does not match field value**
------------------ | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------
``log*`` | log<br>logger | analog
``*log`` | analog<br>alog | logg
``*log*`` | analog<br>alogger | lop
``l*g`` | log<br>logg | lop

  **Supported**     | **Not Supported**
------------------ | ----------------------------------------
``*``<br>``*log``<br>``l*g``<br>``log*``<br>``*log*``	| ``*l*g*``<br>``*l*g``<br>``l*g*``

**Request**
The following example shows the ``'*'`` operator.

```text
GET api/v1/Tenants/default/Namespaces/{namespaceId}/Streams?query=log*
```
