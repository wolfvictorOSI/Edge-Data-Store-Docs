# Prepare egress destinations

OCS and PI Server destinations may require additional configuration to receive OMF messages. 

## OCS

To prepare OCS to receive OMF messages from EDS, create an OMF connection in OCS. Creating an OMF connection results in an available OMF endpoint that can be used by the EDS egress mechanism. Complete the following steps to create an OMF connection:

1. Create a **Client**.
   
   The *Client Id* and *Client Secret* will be used for the corresponding properties in the egress configuration.
   
2. Create an **OMF** type **Connection**.
   
   The connection should link the created client to an existing [namespace](https://ocs-docs.osisoft.com/Content_Portal/Documentation/Management/Account_Namespace_1.html) where the data will be stored.
   The **OMF Endpoint** URL for the connection will be used as the egress configuration *Endpoint* property.

## PI Server

To prepare a PI Server to receive OMF messages from EDS, a PI Web API OMF endpoint must be available. Complete the following steps:

1. Install PI Web API and enable the **OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) Services** feature.
    - During configuration, choose an AF database and PI Data Archive where metadata and data will be stored.
    - The account used in an egress configuration needs permissions to create AF elements, element templates, and PI points.
2. Configure PI Web API to use *Basic* authentication.

 For complete steps, as well as best practices and recommendations, see the [PI Web API User Guide](https://livelibrary.osisoft.com/LiveLibrary/web/pub.xql?c=t&action=home&pub=web-api-v12&lang=en#addHistory=true&filename=GUID-D49D9A09-B47E-4FF7-A9D3-B7C1FEA5E681.xml&docid=GUID-D807EF71-7F37-43DB-A357-EF03CCD001F1&inner_id=&tid=&query=&scope=&resource=&toc=false&eventType=lcContent.loadDocGUID-D807EF71-7F37-43DB-A357-EF03CCD001F1) on Live Library.

**Note:**  The certificate used by PI Web API must be trusted by the device running EDS, otherwise the egress configuration *ValidateEndpointCertificate* property needs to be set to false (this can be the case with a **self-signed certificate** but should only be used for testing purposes).

**Note:**  To continue to send OMF egress messages to the PI Web API endpoint after upgrading PI Web API, restart the EDS service.
