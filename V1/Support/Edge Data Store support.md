# Edge Data Store support

## Edge Data Store documentation feedback

If you have questions, comments, or other feedback about the Edge Data Store documentation, send an email to [Documentation](mailto:documentation@osisoft.com?subject=[DocFX]%20Edge%20Data%20Store).

## Edge Data Store general feedback

If you have questions, comments, issues, and other feedback about the Edge Data Store software, send an email to [Edge support](mailto:edgesupport@osisoft.com).

As a member of the Edge Data Store program, you also have access to a private community on PI Square called [Edge](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/groups/edge). 
The Edge Data Store community is monitored by members of the Edge Data Store development team. 
You can use this site to ask questions, request advice and share ideas about working with the Edge Data Store with other community members.

Once Edge Data Store is released for general availability, access to OSIsoft Technical Support will be available and will be used instead of the previously mentioned options.
