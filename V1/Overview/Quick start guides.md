# Quick start guides
The quick start guides in this section provide basic instructions to get started with Edge Data Store components and utilities. Refer to the respective configuration sections for detailed instructions on each EDS component or utility.

The examples in each quick start guide use curl, a commonly available tool on both Windows and Linux. You can use the same operations with any programming language or tool that supports making REST calls or configure EDS components with the EdgeCmd utility. If available on your device, use a browser to complete data retrieval steps (GET commands) to validate successful configurations.

All quick start guide examples assume EDS has been installed and is accessible through a REST API using the default installed port (5590).
